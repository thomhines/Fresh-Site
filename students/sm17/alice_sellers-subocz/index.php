    <h1>Alice <span>Sellers-Subocz</span></h1>
    <p>Designer, illustrator, cat enthusiast. I like to make things bright, bold, and with personality. My work is heavily influenced by a previous education in science and animal medicine. When I’m not drawing space animals, I’m drooling over texture and pattern. I am ever curious, constantly seeking to expand my abilities and explore new ways to solve design problems. Experimentation excites me.</p>
    <p><strong>If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />By the food. Is there food there?</p>
    <p><strong>My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />Soft, drapey things that disguise how much food I just put in my stomach.</p>
    <p><strong>The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />M.I.A. - Bad Girls</p>
