    <h1>Shannon <span>Dunlop</span></h1>
    <p>I am passionate about people and the process. Design has allowed me to effectively build systems that build relationships and creates conversation. I hope to continue to make work that is efficient, communicative and intentional. I am looking forward to continuing the process outside of Portland State University School of Art+Design.</p>
    <p><strong>If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />At the Alexander Wang after party getting down on the dance floor to Kendrick Lamar.</p>
    <p><strong>My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />My oversized black hoodie.</p>
    <p><strong>The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />“Do you Believe” by Cher</p>
