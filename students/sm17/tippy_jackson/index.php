    <h1>Tippy <span>Jackson</span></h1>
    <p>I am a vocal advocate for arts education and strive to understand all aspects of design. Nothing piques my interest like a new software to get down and dirty in, with bonus points awarded for a new process to learn. I’m obsessed with communication without words, emotion through sound, and rhythm in static images.</p>
    <p><strong>If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />I would sneak backstage and feel all of the fabrics I could get my hands on, in the least creepy way possible.</p>
    <p><strong>My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />Anything that allows me to explore a full range of motion. Restrictive clothing will not be tolerated.</p>
    <p><strong>The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />“Renegade” by Styx. Specifically, the guitar solo. Over and over and over again.</p>
