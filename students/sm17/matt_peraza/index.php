    <h1>Matt <span>Peraza</span></h1>
    <p>I like to think of myself as a very passionate person, in my designs and in my life. I take a lot of pride in the work that I do and I bring an emotional connection to my work. When I’m not designing I am spending time with my family, as they mean the world to be. Deep down I’m a big nerd that likes movies, cartoons and superheroes.</p>
    <p><strong>If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />Attached to the hip of the one or two people I might know. I may need to be close to the bar too.</p>
    <p><strong>My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />An old Steelers sweater that probably should be retired.</p>
    <p><strong>The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />“Play that Funky Music” - Wild Cherry</p>
