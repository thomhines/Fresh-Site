    <h1>Ian <span>Stirewalt</span></h1>
    <p>Born and raised in Portland, Ian is a human trying to make the world better via design. A curious problem solver with a love for Dungeons and Dragons, collaboration, typography, and interactivity.</p>
    <p><strong>If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />Probably trying to find vegan donuts or an iced soy matcha.</p>
    <p><strong>My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />My short black jean shorts, when it’s 107 I can still wear my fav.</p>
    <p><strong>The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />Years &amp; Years, “King”</p>
