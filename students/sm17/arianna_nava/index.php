    <h1>Arianna <span>Nava</span></h1>
    <p>I’m a graphic designer from the Bay Area eager to make art that helps people to connect and communicate effectively. I enjoy logo design, illustration and product packaging and am ready to start working with people who share my same passion for design and craft.</p>
    <p><strong>If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />Contouring and highlighting cheekbones backstage.</p>
    <p><strong>My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />Socks.</p>
    <p><strong>The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />“Let Me Blow Ya Mind” - Eve</p>
