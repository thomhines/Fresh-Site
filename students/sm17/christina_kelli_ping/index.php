    <h1>Christina Kelli <span>Ping</span></h1>
    <p>Christina is a passionate and mindful designer with lyrical taste, and a talent for lettering and illustration. She infuses her design projects with an art and craft sensibility, and is largely inspired by music that explores what it feels like to exist. A creative problem solver at heart, Christina is interested in design that emulates feeling and tells a story.</p>
    <p><strong>If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />At the bar watching people. Not in a creepy way though.</p>
    <p><strong>My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />A dress. I like layers.</p>
    <p><strong>The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />Rihanna, “Bitch Better Have My Money”</p>
