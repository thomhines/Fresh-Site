    <h1>Haley <span>Mills</span></h1>
    <p>During my time in the PSU design program, I have learned that my best and most fulfilling work derives from me embracing all the crazy things I enjoy. I love most things related to pop culture, acting, The Backstreet Boys and National Treasure. I am most passionate about typography and editorial design. As I grow and change, so does my style of design, and I am so excited to see where that pushes me in the years to come!</p>
    <p><strong>If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />Trying to make a famous person fall in love with me.</p>
    <p><strong>My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />My dad’s old and worn-out Steelers sweatshirt. SO cozy!</p>
    <p><strong>The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />Rich Homie Quan, “Flex (K Theory Remix)”</p>
