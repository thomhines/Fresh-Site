    <h1>Lydia <span>Wojack-West</span></h1>
    <p>I am a designer with a firm belief that humor and design can bring people together. I try to incorporate humor into my work through satire, but I also enjoy the light-hearted side of things. Part of what I love about my work is that I can make a visual statement about something I am passionate about, while making jokes about the absurdity of the situation. It’s an amazing feeling to be able to connect to others through laughter and shared experiences.</p>
    <p><strong>If you were to run into me at NY Fashion Week, I would most likely be</strong>: <br />At Nintendo World since I would be in New York.</p>
    <p><strong>My favorite article of clothing is</strong>: <br />One of many cozy knit sweaters!</p>
    <p><strong>The song playing as I strut down the runway would be</strong>: <br />Janelle Monae - “Electric Lady”</p>
