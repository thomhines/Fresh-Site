	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Jessie Woodcock</h1>
	<p>I am a designer who takes pride in concept and craft. My background in psychology, sociology and fine art helps me create memorable experiences through thoughtful branding and packaging solutions. While my heart belongs to paper crafts and power tools, I always enjoy experimenting with new materials.
