	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yui Takahashi</h1>
	<p>Yui Takahashi is a designer and illustrator originally from Japan. Experiencing a new culture in the U.S. changed her aesthetic sense, and now it's been mingled with her Japanese perception. She has the ability to clearly communicate and deliver a new creative perspective, and is always motivated to challenge and adapt to new culture and skills.
