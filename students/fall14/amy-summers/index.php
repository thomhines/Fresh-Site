	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Amy Summers</h1>
	<p>I believe design should be fun, and love to create playful, colorful pieces that will surprise and delight my audience. I began my career in Interior Design, and because of this my graphic design work is inspired by a love of pattern, textiles, and texture with special attention to detail.
