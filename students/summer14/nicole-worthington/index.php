	<p>Nicole Worthington is a Portland native with a passion for clean, efficient design and rad typography. She enjoys concept exploration and the collaborative aspects of design and is always seeking to try new types of projects and art mediums. When not at work or in class, she’s at home curled up with a good book and a mug of coffee or she’s experimenting with new illustration and hand-lettering styles.</p>
