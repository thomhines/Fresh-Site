	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Samantha Sacomano</h1>
	<p>Samantha Sacomano is mostly known for her duo chromatic aesthetic - a "nothing but black" approach. By choosing to create mostly in black and white, Samantha's work is a study in restraint; focusing on form, texture and composition. However, when it comes to campy British reality television, she has zero restraint. She has a working knowledge of art history and photography but finds her greatest inspiration comes from fashion.</p>
