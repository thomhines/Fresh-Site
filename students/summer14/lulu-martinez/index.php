	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Lulu Martinez</h1>
	<p>Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, Lulu Martinez is a Portland-based graphic designer with a passion for hand lettered type, bold textures and bright colors. She is influenced by anything music or food related and is constantly seeking out funky and cool package designs. Lulu takes delight in designing projects that can be opened, held or sipped in one's hands. In her free time she can be found on one of the many trails in the parks in Portland or enjoying a tasty home brew.Â </p>
