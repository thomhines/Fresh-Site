	<p>For Leah, design is more than a job — design is a passion. She loves making icons, designing rectilinear layouts, setting type, kerning to perfection and nerding-out on html/css (something she is learning to publicly embrace). In addition to design, her interests include of documenting street art and the decay of architectural structures, learning to live as simply and sustainably as possible, and spending as much time as possible exploring the great outdoors — far away from any screen.
