	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Charlotte Hill</h1>
	<p>A former ballerina and an old soul, Charlotte is an illustrator, designer, and photographer who is all about creating work that's clever, sweet, and makes hearts beat a little faster. <br><br> Inspired by big ideas, tiny details, and the beautiful complexity of the people who surround her, she holds collaboration near to her heart, and is a firm believer in hard work, being nice, and lip-synching in the car, even when people stare.</p>
