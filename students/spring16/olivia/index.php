        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Olivia Serrill</h1>

        <p>Olivia Serrill is an artist, designer, writer, illustrator, painter, list-maker, storyteller, weird idea-haver, butcher, baker, and candlestick-maker. In her work she values humor and honesty, and has a knack for generating ideas and conceptual thinking. She likes design that makes her forget that itâ€™s been designed and is inspired by all that is extreme, obsessive, and borderline ridiculous. Olivia enjoys buying too many books, pretending to be a music video backup dancer, and making ambitious travel plans.</p>
