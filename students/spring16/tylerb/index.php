        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Tyler Butler</h1>

        <p>Tyler Butlerâ€™s interest in graphic design was sparked with a stack of Road & Track magazines. It was at least a year before he read any of the articles, the overall relationship between large imagery and typography on the page were far more interesting. Now he pairs his love for design with an addiction for mobile technology to explore the present and future of the interface and interactive experiences. He thinks solving design puzzles is rad; putting various pieces together to create a usable product is both exciting and rewarding. Tyler is super laid back but works well under pressure. He loves working with others and bouncing ideas off anyone who will listen.</p>
