        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Angie Fernandez</h1>

        <p>Angie wants to live in a world filled with innovative work, books that come with salt and vinegar chips, and a force field around her keyboard that repels crumbs and animal fur. As a soon to graduate student, she is constantly hunting for new, exciting projects that challenge her to flex those lesser used muscles. She has experience in participatory, publication and web design, as well as branding and illustration. When sheâ€™s not holed up in her office completing a last-minute microscopic edit, you can find her doing home improvement projects or walking her dog along the river.</p>
