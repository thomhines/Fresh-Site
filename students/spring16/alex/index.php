        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Alex Banngertir</h1>

        <p>Alex Banngertir is an Oregon grown graphic designer who will never turn down a challenge to any game. As a bit of a yes man he finds himself in exciting and troublesome environments from time to time. When he's not saving kids from burning buildings he enjoys the finer things in life, like using the shower first in the morning or getting that first bite of ice cream out of a new gallon. Great design is a must of Mr. Banng as he strives to only produce stunning work for the public eye. He thinks of himself as Jack, Jack of all trades, with a broad understanding of all facets of the design community.</p>
