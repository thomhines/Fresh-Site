        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Sadie Burchett</h1>

        <p>Sadie’s real name is Jessica but really she’s a Jane-of-all-trades, picking up skills and hobbies on a whim. When you’re on a team with her, she’ll be the glue that will hold it all together and the prankster that will let it all loose, wavering between the leader and the clown. Though not without an occasional strong opinion, she’d rather listen than talk. She loves climbing trees, groan-worthy puns, and drinking beer on a sunny patio. Her post graduation daydreams include becoming an account planner at the hippest agency in town.</p>
