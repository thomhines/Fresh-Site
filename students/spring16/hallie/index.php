        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Hallie Walker</h1>

        <p>Hallie Walker is a designer, illustrator, problem solver, human woman, and professional
weirdo. She creates work rooted in history, emotion, and humor, and gets especially
fired up over projects where she can let her nerd flag fly. She gets down to folk punk,
victorian taxidermy, petting dogs, and over-analyzing dramatic television. She wishes
she had one million cats, but right now she just has a cactus.</p>
