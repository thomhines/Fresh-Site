        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Tyler Spencer</h1>

        <p>Tyler Spencer was born in Hermiston, Oregon and spent the majority of his formative years in Castle Rock, WA...he would not recommend either. Tyler believes strongly that design is, at its root, a problem solving journey. He takes a lot of joy in applying his existing skills to finding new solutions, and learning new skills as needed. This has helped lead to design solutions for variety of mediums such as print, web, video, screen, apparel and screen printing on unconventional mediums such as wood and even Goodwill paintings. He is looking forward to his career of being regularly paid to push pixels around a screen.</p>
