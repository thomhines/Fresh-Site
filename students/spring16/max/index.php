        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Maxwell Miller</h1>

        <p>Maxwell Miller is a recently graduated graphic design student from Portland State University. Illustration makes up a large chunk of his work but he won't shy away from publication and layout design. He channels his own awkwardness, compulsions, and obsessions into his illustrations and tries to do the opposite with everything else. He needs a haircut and will defend Nic Cage's career until he dies.</p>
