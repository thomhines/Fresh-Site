        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Gavin Miller</h1>

        <p>Gavin treats design as a serious craft. Morning to evening, he is hard at work designing. Logos and branding are Gavin's main focus, with logos being an area he endlessly explores. Gavin loves making things bold, outstanding, and worthwhile, and exploring how good design can combine with physical materials to enhance a brand. Illustration helps add another element to his talents, and Gavin dabbles heavily in hand-lettering.</p>
