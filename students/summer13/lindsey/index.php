<div class="c7 bio">

	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Lindsey Freeman</h1>
	<p>Lindsey was born in the city of Sacramento. She moved a lot growing up: Alturas, CA; Brookings, OR; Sandy, OR; then Portland. Moving around so much as a kid has made her appreciate social interactions, and the complex ways we think and act. Lindsey’s interests lie in editorial, web and user-interface design. She tends to be more attracted to minimalistic approaches that make a complex problem a very intuitive one. In her free time you can find her catching up on the newest Netflix original series, getting her workout on, or indulging in a pint of Haagen-Dazs White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle ice cream. Sometimes all at the same time.
