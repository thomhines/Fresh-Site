	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Maria Perala</h1>
	<p>Born and raised in the beautiful nautical northwest, Maria fell in love with graphic design through photography. She enjoys participatory design, art directing and the narrative behind branding. Maria is rehearsed in layout and publications due to her employment at the Vanguard (P.S.U.’s newspaper) and a lovely internship at The Portland Mercury. She has a love of old movies and house plants(, so it’s a safe assumption her favorite film is “Cactus-blanca”).
