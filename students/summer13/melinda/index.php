	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Melinda Haines</h1>
	<p>An odd bird who loves to hear a good embarrassing story, Melinda enjoys using humor to connect people and create solutions for the appropriate problem. She has a ferocious appetite to collaborate with people who want to shake things up, create dialogue, and ask more questions about everything. Graphic design is a great vehicle for her to explore the facets of how we interpret the world and our surroundings. If her moxy is palpable, that’s because she earned it growing up in Jersey.
