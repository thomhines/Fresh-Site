	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Chance Tagg</h1>
	<p>A native of Golden, Colorado, Chance sees design as a curiosity-feeding entry point into new topics of fascination. Design allows Chance to share this fascination with others. He is interested in branding, packaging, interactive and silk printing. Wherever possible, Chance tries to incorporate his adventurous personality into his work while trying to make people smile. The work that he is most excited about is a result of solutions that are arrived at; not necessarily decided upon. His favorite ride at Oakâ€™s Park is the Screaming Eagle.
