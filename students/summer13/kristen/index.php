	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Kristen Petsche</h1>
	<p>Coming from a family of engineers, Kristen loves breaking down complex design problems into simple solutions. Her design is practical, meaningful, & flexible. She is constantly exploring methods to improve her ways of working and love that there's always more than one way of doing something. Design teaches her that things don't always go according to plan, but this often means there's something better waiting. When Kristen is away from the computer, you will find her running, drinking iced coffee, or outdoors. She swears she cannot get a brain freeze. No, seriously. Buy her a margarita and see.
