	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Zelda Burk</h1>
	<p>Born in Paris and raised in Portland, Zelda’s focus is on print design, branding, typography and environmental design. Pattern makes her giddy. Zelda enjoys design that is both beautiful and functional; simple and playful. She is also very passionate about interior design and architecture. Zelda can eat as many as 20 Chinese dumplings—originally started so people would call her “dumpling,” but as Chinese luck would have it she found them quite enjoyable.
