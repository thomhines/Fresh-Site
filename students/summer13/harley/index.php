	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Harley Wilkins</h1>
	<p>Named by his biker parents after the motorcycle, Harley sees design as a chance to uplift, inspire, or alter one’s perception for the better. A deep thinker and Lite-Brite pattern maker, he likens design as an unsolved puzzle; he knows he has the pieces and he’s working to fit them together. Harley offers friendship, encouragement, and Creepy Crawlers from his ThingMaker.

"I've learned that trying to measure up to others' accomplishments is similar to eating a big bowl of mac'n'cheese; I end up in a state of pained paralysis, suddenly remembering that I should embrace myself for who I am: lactose intolerant."  </p>
