	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Nicole Bittner</h1>
	<p>A Pennsylvania native, Nicole is a graphic designer and printmaker living in Portland. She loves working with her hands which drives her passion for print and packaging design. Nicole believes there is always a small moment of joy when a design turns into a tactile and physical object. She finds herself inspired by the city of Portland—by the handmade, DIY, and amazing craftsmanship—and the creative people who live here. Nicole feels incredibly lucky to live in a place where she is inspired everyday. She loves pickles, thunderstorms and fireflies.</p>
