	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Caitlin Lomen</h1>
	<p>Originally from Seattle, Caitlin is happy to call Portland her home, as well as the place she discovered her love for design. She is inspired by the versatility of watercolor, the colors of the Pacific Northwest, and getting her hands dirty in as many mediums as possible. She also eats her hamburgers “medium.” Her favorite? The one found at Yakuza.
