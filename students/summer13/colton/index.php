	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Colton Major</h1>
	<p>A designer and gun-for-hire, residing in rainy Portland, Ore.â€”Colton likes to work hard and make things. His goal in life is to be a master of the five industrial arts. Colton enjoys eating pizza, listening to metal, and chopping wood. (Clearly he has already mastered three of those five industrial arts.)
