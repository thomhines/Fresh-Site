	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Jeremy O'Connell</h1>
	<p>The year was 1990. Jeremy was born in his parents’ house outside of Portland, Oregon on the hottest September to date—which he thinks really affected the rest of his life. He was promptly whisked away to a small island off the coast of Washington, and raised on a summer camp. Jeremy moved back when he was eight years old and he has been here ever since—doodling, and honing his craft.
