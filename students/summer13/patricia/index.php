	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Patricia Kirsch</h1>
	<p>My favorite thing to do is anything I have never done. I love to try any food that I’ve never tasted. And I love to create designs that I’ve never experimented with. I like to look up when everyone else is looking down. I love taking an active role in the direction of my life, creating memories, experiences, and history along the way. I appreciate a good joke, a challenging puzzle, a good word problem, and a bad pun. Good design facilitates these things. It helps us write our stories. I’m always looking for places where I can collaborate, listen, and learn.</p>
