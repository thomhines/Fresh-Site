	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Silke Kilian</h1>
	<p>Silke is a fan of simple, clever design. She enjoys both interactive/web as well as letterpress and screen printing. Her dream career would be working with clients who appreciate digital and hand-done elements, seeing the benefits of both. While most of her days are spent indoors looking at a screen, she also enjoys spending time in the great outdoors and film photography. Born and raised in Southern Oregon, Silke has also lived in Southern California and Germany(, which is just a stricter version of Southern California).
