        <p>Nina is a human being who illustrates, writes, and graphic designs. She tries to spend equal amounts of time on her laptop and in the woods, but learned early on not to combine those things. Recently, she has been really into basket weaving and playing the banjo. Ask her about her collection of bad jokes or her favorite places to cry on campus.</p>
