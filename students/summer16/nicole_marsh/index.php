        <p>Her business card may say “cat recruiter,” but Nicole is a branding and typography master at heart. Her work is quiet and thoughtful, but she is most interested in working with a goofy creative team to execute bomb projects together, hopefully with the help of an office animal. If she weren’t here making the world a more beautiful place, she would probably be refining her carpentry skills and getting ready to fix up the house of her dreams.</p>
