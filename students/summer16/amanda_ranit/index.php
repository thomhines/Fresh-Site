        <p>Amanda strives for authenticity and looks for every opportunity to break a stereotype. A background in fine dining and scrapbooking led her to graphic design, where she learned to appreciate and craft beautiful packaging projects and more. Ambition drives her to seek a work environment of people who encourage one another to succeed, and always make things better. If you didnâ€™t think that all of this was badass enough, she can also do a one handed push-up.</p>
