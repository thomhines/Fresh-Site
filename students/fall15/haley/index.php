        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Haley Thorne</h1>

        <p>Haley Thorne is a graphic designer and illustrator, born and raised in Portland, Oregon. She grew up in a 100 year old farm house, where she spent much time outside wondering how tree bark was formed, studying the colors of bugs and constantly creating art of every kind. Haley comes from a long line of artists in the family, so it was only natural that she too would fall in love with the arts and creating.
Haley followed her passion and love for art to the University of Oregon for a Bachelor of Science in Fine Arts. Wanting to continue her pursuit for knowledge, she entered Portland State University for a post bachelor degree in graphic design.</p>
