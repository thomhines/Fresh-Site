        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Mauricio Diaz</h1>

        <p>Mauricio Diaz enjoys designing for action sports. During his free time, he likes to play futsal, workout or eat super spicy Mexican food. Having been born and raised in Hillsboro, Oregon he’s been close to Portland all his life. Mauricio has always enjoyed making things by hand and tries to express that throughout his projects. Though he’s been successful in scoring many goals, Mauricio has one goal yet to achieve and that is to work at a company where athletic apparel is their main priority.</p>
