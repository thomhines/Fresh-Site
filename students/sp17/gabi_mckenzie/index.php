    <p>I am an old soul and a designer who loves tactile things and creating stuff by hand. I love making from scratch in everything I do, be it baking bread or starting a project with a sketch. I love pastries, finding peace in a good coffee shop corner, making friends with the old ladies in public libraries, painting walls, going on walks to steal flower clippings from my neighbors, and teaching myself new skills. I really dig the movie "Top Gun", like a lot. </p>
