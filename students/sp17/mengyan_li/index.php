    <p>I’m Mengyan Li. I’m a graphic designer, illustrator, and corgi lover. I started drawing since I was 5 years old. I always knew that I wanted to make things look beautiful and meaningful. I enjoy making things look elegant and I get inspired by the people around me. I thrive to be motivate and inspiring everyday. When I’m not creating creative work, you can find me hanging out with my corgis in the park.</p>
