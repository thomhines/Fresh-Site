    <p>My name is Jessea and I am full-time middle child, virgo to the core, and passionate creative. Design has allowed me to be a free thinker as well as a perfectionist. I am dedicated and passionate about everything that I do, I can't help it! If I am not freelancing in my studio then I am working with other creatives. While playing 15 years of competitive soccer I took on the mentality of playing every game like it were my last. Similarly, I have adapted that attitude dedicating 100% to each project. I love a challenge so lets make a difference together!</p>
