    <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">James <span>Wilson</span></h1>

    <p>James is a colorful creative with a strong passion for photography, experiences, UX design, and queer pop culture. This comes through in his work through inclusive design thinking and creative solutions that are outside of the box. He is always striving to learn new things. When lack of creativity hits he enjoys exploring nature, trying different breweries, and collecting retro game consoles.</p>
