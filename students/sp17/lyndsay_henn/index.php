    <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Lyndsay <span>Henn</span></h1>

    <p>Lyndsay is a breakfast enthusiast, art nerd, dog lady, and recovering perfectionist. She finds inspiration by looking for the mystical in the material. Sheâ€™d like to professionally make things that are tangible, self-aware, and have a story to tell. When not working, Lyndsay can be found loving on people, pups, and plants.</p>
