    <p>I'm happy to report that I unlike many people in the world, I actually love what I do. In my opinion graphic design is something that many people don't really think about unless it isn't there. As a designer and illustrator, I see the value of visual communication and strive to create something meaningful, but also realistic in today's ever-changing eyes.
        <br>I have been freelancing for several years but would also like to settle in with a small team and contribute to bigger ideas and motivations. A lot of my inspiration is self generated through other creative hobbies such as cooking and baking and my general (yet to be fulfilled) desire to design everything!</p>
