    <p>As a graphic designer, my subject matter is to combine professional design skills with contemporary aesthetic to create visual work for solving problems and communicating message in a clear, accessible and effective way. For me, the experience of studying abroad is a major influence and inspiration resources of my work. In my designs, Iâ€™m trying to capture the essence of both Chinese and America cultures. I have the desire to inherent the characteristics of Chinese design and combine it with western design thoughts and I want to develop my own design style, as well as keeping the uniqueness and the originality in my own designs. To me, modern is an approach, not a style, and I also attempt to make works with lasting aesthetic and complex in their meanings transcends short-lived tends.</p>
