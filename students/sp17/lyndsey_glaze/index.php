    <p>Lyndsey is a thoughtful designer whose favorite things are both beautiful and useful. Sheâ€™s motivated and inspired by design that helps the world be just a little bit better. Crafting things with intention, diving into complex ideas and solving problems is her jam. She loves to travel by bike, sip ginger tea, and run in the woods. She has a special appreciation for a good cast iron skillet and believes less is often more.</p>
