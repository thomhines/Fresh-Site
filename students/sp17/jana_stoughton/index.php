    <p>As a graphic designer, I love to create work that has a personality and that speaks in a clear and memorable way. I use my background in fine art to create the heart of a project, in the form of illustration and hand lettering. Once I make those key elements I build the rest of the project digitally. I chose to pursue graphic design because I find that its restrictions inspire me to push myself creatively and produce stronger visual work that has something to say. I stay inspired, work hard, and look for solutions in unexpected places. When Iâ€™m not designing you can find me playing video games, hanging out with my sister, or playing fetch with my cat. Sometimes all three.</p>
