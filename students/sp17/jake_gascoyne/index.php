    <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Jake <span>Gascoyne</span></h1>

    <p>Jake Gascoyne spends nearly all waking hours daydreaming about the subject of design and the design of other subjects. Between all of that, he can’t believe there was ever a time when he used to get bored (he kind of misses that feeling, but knows it’s better this way). Jake grew up around the skateboarding industry, which was essentially a decade-long immersion school of visual culture for him. Jake likes things that are funny, clever, weird, charming, and cool. He is very adept at writing in third person. </p>
