    <p>Hello, my name is Huijuan Qiu, and I go by Jenny! I like to design, illustrate, and draw. I am passionate about working with different textures, seizing any chance to explore a new medium, and teaching myself new skills. Most of my design aesthetics come from my experiences while traveling. I enjoy meeting new people, sharing stories, and embracing new cultures in different countries. In my spare time, I enjoy shopping; I find inspiration by looking at the beautiful and fun things in stores.</p>
