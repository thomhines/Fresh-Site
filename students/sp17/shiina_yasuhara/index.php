    <p>Growing up in a family of artists, Iâ€™ve always had a great appreciation for paintings. In my work with graphic design, I find myself inspired by both classic painters as well as my experiences traveling to new places. I love illustrating, and I hope to become a successful illustrator someday.</p>
