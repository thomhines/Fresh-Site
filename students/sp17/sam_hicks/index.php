    <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Sam <span>Hicks</span></h1>

    <p> I am a graphic designer and motorcycle enthusiast. I am currently located in Portland Oregon and consider my self lucky to be living in such a creative city. I love my work and enjoy every project I work on. I am a big science nerd and have a secret love for hair bands from the 80's. I have a passion for layout and branding and enjoy UX/UI projects. </p>
