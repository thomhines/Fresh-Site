    <p>Creative activities have always drawn my attention. From a young age I would draw, color, cut and create. Even now as a designer, I’m still very much like this, I often find myself getting into a “zen” moment where time goes by and I lose track of everything because I enjoy the challenges which design presents and communicates my ideas as solutions. My creativity thrives within both print work and screen work, such as branding, web, motion graphic, packaging and UX design. I’m expecting to experience more and push my design thinkings further in the future.</p>
