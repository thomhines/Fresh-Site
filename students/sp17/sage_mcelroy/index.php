    <p>Hello! My name is Sage but my friends call me Sàjé (sah-jhay). As a designer, my focus is to create compelling digital and interactive work, with a strong interest in environmental design. I am most excited about creating platforms and experiences that people can interact with, whether that be in a digital or physical setting. Ultimately, my main goal is to create immersive experiences that are unique and engaging to a wide range of audiences.</p>
