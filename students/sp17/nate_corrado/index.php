    <p>My name is Nate Corrado, but most of my friends just call me @natecorrado for internet purposes. I am a graphic designer with a passion for imagery and illustrative qualities. I am a question asking machine (when appropriate) with a curiosity that is deeply rooted in my passion of all things visual and or creative. Im always on the hunt for conversation, and from that gathering any and all knowledge from others. I love looking at cultures and languages and how to find multiple levels of meaning in a clever way. My daily equation for success is eating at least one apple, drawing something, and at least one episode of Curb your Enthusiasm. Keeps me sharp. </p>
