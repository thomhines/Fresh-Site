    <p>Man of the future—literally. I have not been born yet, and I’ve travelled back in time to spread my love for the creative potential within the visual medium. Where I come from, printed media has been relegated to public libraries, yellow pages, and fortune cookies. I have always felt I should have been born into a time where AI and social media algorithms did not produce all graphical content consumed by humans. Your world of books, cellular telephone cameras, and pencils inspired me to become a visual artist. I look forward to pursuing a career through continuing my understanding of your contemporary media while hopefully sharing my visions of the future with anyone who has an open mind.</p>
