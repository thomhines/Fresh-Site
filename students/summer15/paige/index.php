        <p>​Paige Buda is a traveler, student, and creative. When not in Portland, Oregon she’ll be globetrotting collecting patterns, photos, and stories. She embraces the mistakes of the hand, natural textures, bold type, and quiet colors.  Paige believes that design is about relationships, obsessive research, shaping a narrative, and stretching boundaries to create a beautiful piece of work; and she loves every second of it.</p>
