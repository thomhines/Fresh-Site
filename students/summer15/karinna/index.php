        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Karinna Bunn</h1>

        <p>​Karinna Bunn hails from the pretty cool state of Idaho, and came to Portland two years ago to pursue graphic design. She has always been a creator and discovered graphic design through her grandpa’s screen printing shop as a kid. Karinna’s design is influenced by her unique illustration style, and her love of typography and color. She is interested in using graphic design as a tool for positive social change, and believes that good design can have a lasting impact. In the fall of 2014 she worked as an intern at Bitch Magazine, and assisted with the design of the (RE)Visions issue. When Karinna is not designing, she is exploring the coast, or spending time with family and friends.</p>
