        </ul>
        <p>Born on an Island, raised in the midwest, a veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard. I have lived in many different locations, and have many interests. Sports in particular has always been a constant part of my life, wherever my life has taken me. I aspire to use my passion for sports and exploration to further the boundaries of what should be expected when it comes to sports, design and technology. </p>

        <h2>Kansas State Rebrand</h2>
        <p>An exercise in restraint I took a well known symbol the Powercat and modernized it without fully divesting from the existing brand. A brand system was created as well as a marketing campaign to help guide both print and digital applications.</p>
