        <p>Hi, i’m Kim. I love the outdoors and working with my hands! I'm originally from NW Indiana outside of Chicago and moved to Portland, Oregon about 9 years ago. I graduated from cosmetology school in 2007, but got tired of cleaning people’s feet, so I went back to school for Graphic Design. I have an Associates in Graphic Design from Portland Community College, and will be graduating in 2016 with my Bachelors of Science in Graphic Design.</p>
