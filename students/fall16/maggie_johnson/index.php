        <p>I am a graphic designer with a love for thoughtful branding, fun patterns, innovative packaging, and eye-catching color palettes. Hard work, risk taking, and detail-oriented ideation are the tools that I use to create. I am truly passionate and excited about graphic design, and I feel that energy comes through in my work. Having grown up in colorful Colorado, my love for the outdoors and adventure is innate. I find inspiration in my surroundings, my friends, my family, and forward thinkers. I also love cheese, cats, TV, and not taking myself too seriously.</p>
