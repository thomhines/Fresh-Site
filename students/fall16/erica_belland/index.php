        <p>I am a graphic designer who focuses on illustration, production and product development with a DIY focus. Enthusiasm, positivity and my love of working with people are at the core of everything that I do. When I am not giving people high fives or jamming on design work, you can find me running around the outdoors or coming up with new pins and prints for my soon-to-be online shop Good Good Golden. </p>
