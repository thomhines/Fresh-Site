         <p>My creativity thrives within branding, web & app design, motion graphics, and filmmaking. I'm passionate about details and how they help to elevate my work. I find satisfaction in cleanliness and simplicity.
When I'm not designing, you can find me at yoga, spin class, or the gym. Fitness is one of my obsessions, but so is Salt & Straw; life is all about balance, right? I plan on using my creativity to fuel my desire to travel the world. I also like cats.</p>

        <h2>Gainer App</h2>
        <p>This app helps weight-lifters work towards their goals and view their progress in an organized way. The process of recording weights and reps is streamlined so the user is ready for their next set. I designed this app using Google's Material Design as a guideline. </p>

        <p>A few logos from branding projects, animated. These quick animations draw attention to the details, and help to bring the brands to life.</p>

        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>When I was 17, I made a mistake that changed my life, as well as the lives of others. Car accident, comatose, rehab, lawyer, felony, license suspension. This motion piece sums up the situation I've dealt with for the past 6 years of my life.</p>

        <h2>Stargazer Vineyards</h2>
        <p>These wine bottles educate consumers on exo planets and the sensory composition of the wine. The atmosphere is the aroma, the crust is the texture, the mantle is the taste, the outer core is the flavor, and the inner core is the aftertaste.</p>
