        <p>I am a graphic designer focused on print design with a passion for typography. There is value in the tactile quality of printed materials, and I want to help create meaningful printed documents and stories. With dual degrees—graphic design from Portland State and marketing from Gonzaga—I approach design projects with consumer-focused thinking.</p>
