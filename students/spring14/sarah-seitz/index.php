	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Sarah Seitz</h1>
	<p>Sarah Seitz has loved art and creativity her whole life, it wasnâ€™t until she came to Portland State that she learned about and found her passion for design. Sarah appreciates work that is clean, simple, detail oriented, and interactive with the user in both digital and print formats. She loves learning new things and incorporating those skills and ideas in her work. When she is not designing, she enjoys cooking, anything outdoors, traveling, exploring her surroundings, plus the occasional movie or two.</p>
