	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Landon Tuff</h1>
	<p>Landon Tuff is a graphic designer and self-proclaimed computer geek who designs website with Drupal, an Open-Source Content Management System.  As a child of the 80â€™s, he used a Tandy laptop to teach himself BASIC programming.  His love of all things electronic led to a six year stint in the US Air Force testing and repairing electronics and security systems.  Now free to combine his loves of technology and design, he especially enjoys projects involving auto and music sub-cultures and all things geeky.  In his free time he enjoys relaxing with his wife and two cats at their Happy Valley home.</p>
