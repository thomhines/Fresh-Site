	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Sara Franks</h1>
	<p>Being Persian and growing up in Germany before moving to Portland has given Sara a fresh, multicultural perspective in the art of graphic design, and she often incorporates international elements in her work. Being immersed in different cultures and speaking three different languages gives Sara the ability to see things in new and innovative ways and to work with people of any background. She’s a natural collaborator, getting inspiration from talking to clients, working on extensive group projects and always working to make others happy. Graphic design is Sara’s way to bring joy to others through art.</p>
