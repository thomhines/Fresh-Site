	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Michelle Leigh</h1>
	<p>Michelle Leigh is a designer and illustrator who believes in the power of print, pattern, and cat eye glasses. As an awkward kid growing up in a sleepy town, she was shaped by countless afternoons spent at her hometown library, where she discovered alternative comics, weird movies, semiotics, art history, and a great love for words and how they are laid out on the page. Her favorite projects involve pop culture, critical theory, or unexpected connections between subjects. In her spare time she enjoys binging Netflix while carving block prints, writing, and searching for the perfect vintage dress.</p>
