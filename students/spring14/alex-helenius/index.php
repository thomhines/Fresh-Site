	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Alex Helenius</h1>
	<p>Alex Helenius is not just a designer, but a critical thinker and doer. His passion for design comes from a fascination with geometry, using the grid and exploring quality type. A believer that form follows function, he crafts apps and brands that work effectively without compromising quality. He does not see failure as a setback, but as an opportunity to learn and grow. While not working on design projects, he enjoys video games, playing a mean blues riff and hanging out with friends and family.</p>
