	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Corey Van Hoosen</h1>
	<p>Corey Van Hoosen is a Graphic Designer and Illustrator living in Portland, Oregon. He loves cycling, outer space, hiking, gaming, piano, and green tea. He is a deeply curious person which shows up in his work with themes of science, philosophy, and a respect for nature. His style generally relies on friendly, hand-drawn illustrations punctuated by strong, often bright color schemes. He also enjoys working with code to create interactive online experiences which mesh with his illustrations. His favorite projects tend to be those in which he can translate abstract ideas into easy-to-digest visual representations.</p>
