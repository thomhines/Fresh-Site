	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cassandra Swan</h1>
	<p>Cassandra Frances Swan believes design works best when it helps people do good things. Her work with Ecotrust and the Friendtorship program at PSU  (a mentorship opportunity for underserved high school students), has focused on finding connection and meaning in design. Art excites her the most when it provokes important conversation, affects positive change, and gives others joy.</p>
	<br/><p>Cassandra has worked extensively with Friendtorship, as well as in-house with the School of Art + Design at PSU. She is currently working on her first picture book and is always looking for more people to draw.</p>
