	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Cody Sprague</h1>
	<p>Cody Sprague is a designer with a focus in branding, web and heavy metal. A Central Oregon native, he grew up with the Badlands in his backyard. Endless desert and rocks forced his imagination to work harder and helped him become the creative person he is today. The great open spaces are where he learned to generate ideas and continue to inspire him today. The thrill of creating something from nothing connects him to the design world and pushes him to adapt and learn new techniques.</p>
