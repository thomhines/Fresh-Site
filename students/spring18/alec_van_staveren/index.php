    <h2>Manabu</h2>
    <p>I was inspired the impressive amount of mascots I came into contact with when traveling through Japan in the summer of 2017. Adhering to the characterizations of wacky Yuru-kyara mascots, I created a character based on the experiences I had abroad – available as a sticker on the Line app under “Manabu’s Adventures.”</p>

    <h2>Festicide</h2>
    <p>A proposed rebrand for the Portland D.I.Y. music festival. I used Letraset rub-off lettering on posters and booklets in homage to the earlier days of Portland’s punk scene.</p>

    <h2>Barkeno Brewing</h2>
    <p>In creating a line of imported beer bottles from Barcelona, I sought to attract a younger crowd of craft beer drinkers by combining illustrated type / hand drawn brand attributes with a dynamic typographic layout.</p>

    <h2>Isometric Bowling</h2>
    <p>For this isometric illustration, I set out to learn how a pinsetter machine works and break down the process step by step. I had fun creating a small world of bowling inspired by isometric video games.</p>
