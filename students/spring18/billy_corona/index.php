    <p>Billy loves typography, publication design, and all things craft. He's a knowledge-seeking, Polaroid-shooing, coffee-drinking, making, thinking, social introvert. He focuses on making work that combines analog and digital technology to evoke an emotional response from the viewer. Billy is unapologetically nostalgic and tries not to take himself too seriously all the time.</p>
