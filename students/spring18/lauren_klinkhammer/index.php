    <h2>Wolpertinger</h2>
    <p>Wolpertinger is a branding and packaging design project. I created Wolpertinger as a fresh take on German beer identities. While the aim is to be more fun and less traditional, the brand doesn't lose touch with Bavarian storytelling and symbolism.</p>

    <h2>Purlgrrrl</h2>
    <p>Purlgrrrl is a brand and packaging identity for my knitting-enthusiast friend, Fiona. A heavily tattooed woman who loves punk rock, she needed a new identity for her small business that spoke true to herself and stood out in the mosh pit. </p>

    <h2>Portland Mercury cover</h2>
    <p>This Mercury cover was a practice in illustration and page design. I wanted to illustrate Portland's Burger Week as a large inviting spectacle. I was inspired by large public art installations that involve the whole community. </p></p>
