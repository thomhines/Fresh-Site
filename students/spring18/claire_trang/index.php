    <p>These care instructions are for these types of flowers. The iris, tulip, and daffodil are all drawn in colored pencils by me. The front shows the name of the plant and the black shows its scientific name along with the care instructions.</p>

    <h2>Sproutlings</h2>
    <p>Sproutlings is the brand for my chocolate bars. The target audience for this brand would be children. There is a little poem on the back to teach them more about the importance of how the food they eat may affect their growth. Ingredients for this brand of chocolate are all organic and are gained through fair trade.</p>
