    <h2>Be Honest 2018</h2>
    <p>Be Honest is the annual PSUGD student showcase held at Wieden + Kennedy where students display their work and have an opportuinty to talk about and get feedback from design professionals. With a team of other PSU students I worked on creating a campaign around the theme of 'Falling into Place'. Playing off the idea of Rube Goldburg machines where there is a serise of small chain reactions that achieve an ultimate goal, we related this to the student experience of finding place in the design world.</p>

    <h2>Ewing Speed Systems Branding</h2>
    <p>Rick Ewing has a mind at work, when he retires his dream is to open a workshop where he makes custom skateboards, bikes, scooters, model airplanes and really anything that moves. Together we developed Ewing Speed Systems, his workshop brand that embodies the engineering process behind each project and the thrill of riding on one of his designs.</p>

    <h2>Torch</h2>
    <p>Torch is a newspaper that focuses on female ceramicists, highlighting the rad women working in this art from. One of the goals for this project was to step outside of my comfort zone and work with more modern type. Throughout the publication I used type and image treatment to mimic the smooth, hand formed nature of ceramics. I also referenced the process of glazing by using overlays and layers.</p>
