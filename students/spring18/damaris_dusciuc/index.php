    <p>Damaris is a designer who started out on a pirated Photoshop CS2 version and self-taught HTML/CSS tutorial sites. Growing up, she fell in love with print design and would shove her face in books (literally). Today, she still shoves her face in books, and loves to experiment between digital and physical mediums with her work.</p>

    <h2>HOWL'S CASTLE</h2>
    <p class="p_noborder">A creative coding project as well as deconstruction exercise. I took apart <i>Olly Moss’ Howl’s Moving Castle</i> poster to create an interactive website using HTML, CSS, and some jQuery. I challenged myself to implement as little jQuery script as possible, and used CSS animation for most of the moving DIV elements.</p>
