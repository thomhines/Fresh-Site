    <h2>Well</h2>
    <p>Well is a home bartending experience which helps educate novice drinkers and home bartenders how to make their favorite drinks on their own.

    <h2>Be Honest Website</h2>
    <p class="p_noborder">Every year the Be Honest website is re-designed, and relaunch to help promote the yearly event. For this year’s website, we re-imagined how we could input all 128 participates information onto the website in an efficient matter by using JavaScript and a CSV file to auto-populate each entry. This saved us hours of manual coding and helped establish a reliable system for future edits.</p>

    <h2>Nike Vapor One Football</h2>
    <p>The Vapor One, Nike’s top-tier and premium football, used in NCAA division one football games, demands premium quality.  This was a professional freelance project, in which Nike requested a refreshed design to their Vapor Football series’s packaging. The goal was to develop graphics which were appropriate for the Nike Football category while establishing a premium look and feel. The Vapor One’s packaging also informed the look of the other three football’s (the Vapor 24/7, Vapor 48, and Nike Spin) in the series.</p>
