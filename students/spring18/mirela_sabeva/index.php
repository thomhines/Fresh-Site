    <p>My name is Mirela and I am a Bulgaria born, Portland raised Graphic Designer, Illustrator, and part-time painter. I love page layout and experimenting with typography. I am also very much into simple illustrations. In my spare time and when my anxiety permits, I love to travel around the world and explore different cultures, as well as spend time with friends, family and my crazy dogs.</p>

The students were to create their very own DIY movie trailers by acting and using props they made.</p>
