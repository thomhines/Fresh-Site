    <h2>Rhetoric Black</h2>
    <p>Rhetoric Black is a typeface based on the fundamentals of blackletter, but with a softer approach. The purpose of this typeface was to create something that could be versatile and used in many different settings/applications. As blackletter is know to be tied to negative connotations, I tried to distance the design away from heavily recognizable features by incorporating unique curves, yet still holding onto traditional characteristics.</p>
