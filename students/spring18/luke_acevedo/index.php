    <p>Luke is driven to create bold and memorable brand experiences, leave a great story, keep it fun, and really just make some cool work with cool people. Luke enjoys good food, dusty vintage stores, and getting outside to run on trails. As a recovering ultramarathoner, he brings this discipline, hard work, and enthusiasm into creative projects. </p>

    <h2>OBJ Pins</h2>
    <p>Pin designs and concepts created for a special release of the Odell Beckham Jr. Nike AF-1. The shoe and series were inspired by the New York Taxi Cab, and represent the cityâ€™s unique culture and energy.</p>

    <h2>Rose City Rogues</h2>
    <p>I loved Beavers baseball games while growing up, and decided to reimagine a new team for Portland. This branding is inspired by history, but also geared towards meeting future challenges with a determined, underdog mentality.</p>
