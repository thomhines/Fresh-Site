    <h2>Italian Soda packaging design</h2>
    <p>Italian soda has always been one of the most favorable drinks to beat thirst in the summer heat. It delivers a moment of relief, and its flavor kicks in energy to help you keep going. To me, having a bottle of Italian soda inspires me and powers me up. It’s like seeing sun rise, a moment that you’re expecting great things to happen next. So it’s intuitive to apply the design with an uptempo color selection. Then come the idea of Hello. The word “hello” goes beyond just a greeting. It’s the beginning of an exciting new relationship. It embraces that moment of truth when we share happiness in our life. The two straws replacing letter “L”, and now it’s time for you to share.</p>
