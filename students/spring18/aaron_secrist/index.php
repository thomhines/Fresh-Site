    <h2>Forge</h2>
    <p>A publication for the modern blacksmith, this issue of Forge Monthly contains an article on the history of the profession. The typography was heavily inspired by medieval blackletter, and the rigid layout is reminiscent of the technology during the time when blacksmithing was a common practice.</p>

    <h2>Lightbus</h2>
    <p>This was a branding project for a fictional intergalactic transit service, Lightbus. The user experience was a big part of this project, because thinking about how people would actually use the service affected the branding as well as the final deliverables like boarding passes, uniforms, and signage.</p>

    <h2>Run Album Packaging</h2>
    <p>A redesign for the album Run by Awolnation, this project was focused on the packaging of the record itself. The graphics on the cover were inspired by the imagery and vibes of the lyrics, as well as my personal interpretation of the album.</p>
