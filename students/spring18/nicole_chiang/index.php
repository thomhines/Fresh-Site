    <h2>Kith & Kin</h2>
    <p>Family is an important aspect of every human’s life. It’s perceived value and meaning varies from person to person. As an diverse cultural student, who has been studying abroad for years. Because of the unique experience, I have started thinking about what does family mean to me. More specifically, how does the age affect relationship with family as we age? In this book, we will be able to gain an insight of other's view on family.</p>

    <h2>Milk'em</h2>
    <p>Milk'em was inspired from my childhood memory. My mother started to make her own recipe by mixing with fruits and vegetables with milk in order to make the milk tastier for me. Milk'em's packaging emphasizes a healthy lifestyle by including a nutritious yet satisfying beverage in one's diet.</p>

    <h2>Chao Co</h2>
    <p>These sets of packages include three chocolate bars, coco powder bottle, and a cupcake box. The concept of the logo was inspired from the shape of the world. I decided to use half of a globe to create an abstract shape. Also the name of Chao Co was directly translated from Chinese. By combining these two concepts, I am able to show how the branding story connects with the logo.</p>
