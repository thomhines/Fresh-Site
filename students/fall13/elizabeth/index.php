	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Elizabeth Welch</h1>
	<p>Elizabeth Welch’s love for illustration first appeared through doodles on her math homework and became a large enough part of her life to pursue an education in art. She first came to Portland State as a Fine Arts major making the jump to Graphic Design three years in, in an attempt to spice up her artistic life. It worked and she discovered web design in the process, something she enjoyed because of how different it is than illustration. Plus she’s got a knack for coding! Elizabeth is always looking for new things to try out, currently that thing is making comics. In her free time she loves baking, spending time outdoors, and playing video games.</p>
