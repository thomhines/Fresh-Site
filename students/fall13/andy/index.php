	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Andy Carlson</h1>
	<p>Andy Carlson is a freelance designer at heart, and a particularly driven individual. Since 2008, he has balanced going to school full-time with work in the field of design. Recently he co-founded the ESC Collective, who spent the summer building 12 geodesic domes for the Summit Series in Utah. He is always seeking the next challenge. This might be why he has attended three colleges and explored almost every available medium. He knows the importance of taking a step back and seeing design from someone else’s perspective. It’s part of the reason complex user experience problems keep him awake at night. </p>
