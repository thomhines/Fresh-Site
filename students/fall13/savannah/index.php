	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Savannah Julian</h1>
	<p>Savannah Julian made the trek up north from southern Oregon to study technical theatre. Somewhere between costume production and set building she found herself in a design class and never looked back. Much of Savannahâ€™s work is influenced by a love for historical ephemera and typography. Her values include hard work, critical thinking, and a methodical workflow. When not behind the computer, she enjoys cooking, crafting, and watching TV with her two cats. Going forward she plans to continue applying her design sensibilities to the web, studying type design, and tackling some larger collaborative projects.</p>
