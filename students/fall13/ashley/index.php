	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Ashley Turner</h1>
	<p>Ashley Turner is a dedicated team player who likes using her hands to craft things out of various materials. She really loves cut paper, doodles and things that have a slight childish nature to them while still being thoughtful and well designed. Designs that have somewhat of a dark tone to them, but are still visually pleasing, or even cute, appeal to Ashley because she thinks it offers an interesting conflict of emotion. She has found a recent appreciation for mobile app design and enjoys trying to bring a tangible artistic style to life on the screen. <br>
She also really likes patterns and creepy bugs.</p>
