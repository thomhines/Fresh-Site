	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Kengo Olsen</h1>
	<p>Kengo Olsen isn’t your typical Japanese import. He’s an import that loves cute and effective design. He believes design can be used to encourage happiness and critical thinking about social issues. In order to accomplish these goals, he works diligently to use his skills in illustration, hand-drawn type, vector design, branding, and design within physical spaces. In his ideal world, good design makes for a happier and more thoughtful population.<br>
And by the way, Kengo freaking loves bananas!</p>
