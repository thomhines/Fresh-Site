	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Meg Myers</h1>
	<p>Meg Myers is an illustrator and designer living in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Creativity is her hobby. Design is her passion. Art is her life. Thereâ€™s an intense need to create all the time. She is always doodling, always thinking, and always finding new ways to look at things. When the mood strikes she also fancies herself an amateur photographer.<br>
Additionally, she has a love of classic films, antiquing, family outings, cats, a proper cup of tea, literature, making new friends, Christmastime, and singing loudly along to the car radio during her morning commute. </p>
