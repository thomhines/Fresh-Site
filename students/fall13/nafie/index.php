	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Nafie Gorman</h1>
	<p>It was Nafie Gorman’s love affair with illustration that led him to pursue a career in graphic design. Now he enjoys a longer list that includes coding, front-end, and logo design. He treats each project as an opportunity to try a new design approach. It’s a way to have fun with it, which ultimately gives his work a personality of its own.<br>
He has a thing for music from 1975-'85, growing plants, and bicycling. He also comes from a family of Olympic swimmers.</p>
