    <p>My name is Kate and I am a designer, illustrator and all around creative gal living in Portland, Oregon. I believe that art and design touch all parts of life and that's what really inspires me to keep making - no matter what it is.</p>

<p>I grew up in the foothills of the Oregon Cascades surrounded by big trees, lots of animals and good people. Over the years I also fell in love with the city of Portland which ultimately fed my creative hunger and led to a career in graphic design.</p>
    <h4 class="bio_question">How many plants have died by your hand?</h4>
    <p>I love plants but I think I have killed pretty much every single one I have ever been in charge of and its really starting to bum me out.</p>

    <h2>World Naked Bike Ride</h2>
    <p>In 2017 I was tasked with creating the visual campaign for WNBR PDX. The assets included posters, flyers, bike seat covers, and a wide variety of ads and social media immagery and designs.</p>

    <h2>Guilty</h2>
    <p>While studying abroad at Massey University, NZ in their visual communication design program, we were given the task of creating a design conference and branding all materials for it. “Guilty” came from my interst in exploring the topics surrounding ethical design including plagerism, social influence, sustainability, as well as many other moral dillemas in the industry of graphic design. </p>

    <h2>Eclipsed</h2>
    <p>Celebrating the recent 2017 American Eclipse, this whimsical take on in the event melts the lines between reality and imagination as the night sky mischievously perches atop the golden silver of the sun. </p>

    <h2>The Taylor Wedding
</h2>
    <p>My best friend was married in the summer of 2017 and I took on the role of event planner and designer for the entire wedding. I took care of venue research and reservations, decorations and color palette, floor plan and spatial design, way finding, day of operations, photo editing and all print design.</p>
