    <p>Shannon loves to communicate with bold imagery and punchy colors. She finds inspiration to do that by being around others or by falling deep into research. Her ultimate goal is to create a safe and positive environment for others to experience their true creative selves and to share honest thoughts. Whether that is a physical space or by providing presence, she will make it happen. She also can't make it through a movie without falling asleep.</p>
    <h4 class="bio_question">What is your favorite plant?</h4>

    <h2>Birth Control Poster</h2>
    <p>The fuel for this project was provided by my shitty sex-ed class as a young person. As I got older and talked with more and more people about the subject, I realized that it wasn't just me that got subpar information about such an important subject. I created this poster as part of my thesis to encourage others to have a conversation about safety and consent when it comes to sex.</p>

    <h2>Rabbit Painting</h2>
    <p>I think the best part about this painting is that its about 7 feet long. I am deeply inspired by animals and human anatomy, so thus this painting was born. I used house paint and acrylic on a homemade canvas to create this beast!</p>
    <img class="artwork" src="students/fall17/shannon_kidd/skidd_image3.jpg" alt="Cassette Magazine">
    <h2>Cassette Magazine</h2>
    <p>Reading and collecting feminist design magazines is one of my favorite past times, but I was never able to find a publication about women cyclists that marries the sport and design together. So I decided to make one!</p>
    <img class="artwork" src="students/fall17/shannon_kidd/skidd_image4.jpg" alt="New Crease Magazine">
    <h2>New Crease Magazine</h2>
    <p>Another publication, but this time all about the world of Avant Garde cosmetics! I used this project as a fun exercise to break myself out of my traditional layout methods and to play with everything from imagery, distorted type, and excessive color. Opulence and madness together in one issue!</p>
