	<p>
	I enjoy the opportunity to help businesses and nonprofits build and improve their identity to become more recognizable and cohesive. My enthusiasm for typography, photography and illustration is implemented throughout my designs. When I’m not designing things and taking pictures, you’ll find me drinking mass amounts of coffee, chillin with my friends, cats and hubby, training for a half marathon, or planning my next adventure.
