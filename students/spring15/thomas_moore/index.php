	<p>
	My inspirations are the outdoors, personal health and fitness, and design and illustration. When I was a kid I remember that design was something that I was always excited about, and as I’ve grown it is something that I have only loved more. Whenever I create I like to try and put a sense of movement into my work, I want my work to feel like it is going somewhere and I try to make that something of which I’m aware.There are few things that make me happier than if I can make something complex seem simple and engaging.
