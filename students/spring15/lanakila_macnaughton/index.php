	<p>
	I am a Portland based creative director, photographer and motorcyclist. I founded the Women's Moto Exhibit, a traveling photo exhibition documenting the new wave of women motorcyclists. From a young age I was involved in many outdoor sports and that is where I began documenting my experiences through photography. After developing a passion for motorcycles in my early twenties, I started documenting many facets of motorcycle culture through my lens. I shoot in medium format on a 65 year old Hasselblad CM. I am involved with brands like Harley Davidson and Triumph motorcyles. My aim is to create a new empowered perspective of women in popular society and the motorcycle culture.
