	<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Chaylee Brown</h1>
	<p>Urban Dictionary defines me as "baked ham", but don't be fooled, in reality I'm way less delicious and probably smarter. I like to draw, make people laugh, and dink around on my computer all day. When I learned I could combine these talents into a career, my heart exploded.
