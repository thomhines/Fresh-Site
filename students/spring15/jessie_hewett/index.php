	<p>
	I am a creative from planet earth who loves cute things and aspires to make work that speaks to the inner child. My inspiration comes from animation, history and most noticeably Japanese pop culture. My strengths/interests are in pattern and surface design, packaging, illustration and web. I like making stuff that makes people happy. Someday soon I plan to move to Tokyo to make use of my double major in Graphic Design and Japanese.	</p>
