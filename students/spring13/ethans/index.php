				<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">ethan allen smith</h1>
				<p>
				I am a designer, thinker, explainer, and storyteller. I love making
bad things look good and good things look better. I thrive on
collaboration and critique, and am always looking for ways to
improve my work and the work of those around me. Iâ€™ve been
a professional designer for nearly two decades, am an avid
photographer, a perpetual learner, and a fierce advocate for art
education. My wife is my best cheerleader, my three kids are my
greatest source of inspiration, and in everything, I am endlessly
enthusiastic.</p>
