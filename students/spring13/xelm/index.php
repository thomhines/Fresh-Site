				<p>
My art is something great, weird, and often stupid. I have found
that if you expect too much from what you create, you will
undoubtedly fall on your face. I enjoy playing with typography,
page layout, bookbinding, illustration, crafting with my hands, and I
silkscreen every chance I get.</p>
