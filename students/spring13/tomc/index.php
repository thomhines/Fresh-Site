				<p>
I am inspired by friendship and humility. I take personal responsibility
to help create quality solutions for all the work and people I
am involved with. Design thinking has been the most satisfying
and diverse education I have ever pursued. Nothing carries the
opportunities to learn something new as often or as effectively as
design. Not only have I enjoyed trying new things, I have cultivated
my talents for illustration, web development, and page layout. My
time at Portland State University has been immensely rewarding,
and I look forward to working in a creative community that values
friendship, creativity, and a diversity of style.</p>
