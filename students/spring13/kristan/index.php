				<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">krista nuro</h1>
				<p>
				I am an illustrator, a designer, and a cat lover born and raised just
outside of Portland, Oregon. Growing up with a background in fine
art, I enjoy taking a hands-on approach to design. As often as possible,
I use illustration and hand-rendered typography. My work tends to
take on a dainty, whimsical quality, with a strong versatility through
different media. I have found a passion for a wide array of design skills,
including web development, interactivity, book binding, printmaking,
and package design. I am inspired by fantasy worlds, patterns, cute
critters, and Studio Ghibli.</p>
