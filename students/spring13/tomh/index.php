				<p>
I am a graphic designer, motion enthusiast, obsessive podcast
listener, and comedy addict in Portland, Oregon. I tend to
laugh first and ask questions later. I often follow conversational
tangents into ridiculous anecdotes. Telling a good story is one of
my favorite things to do, and I love that design is an opportunity
to tell amazing stories. Design gives me an outlet for my creative
thoughts, solidify them and produce work that is thoughtful,
meaningful, and beautiful. This mindset has pushed me to explore
all facets of graphic design and my curiosity has given me great
experience in interactive, print, motion, and identity design.</p>
