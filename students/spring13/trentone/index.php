				<p>
A man of fickle interests and short attention span, I am always
on the lookout for something new and engaging. I love extreme
forms of music, outdoor adventures, cycling, and learning more
about different cultures. I crave meaning, purpose and growth in
everything I do. I am fascinated by the intersection of design and
social change. I love exploring the blurred boundaries between
design and fine art. I believe in placing subtle yet clever elements in
my design that reward only those viewers invested enough to notice
them and I most enjoy finding intentional and inventive ways to
utilize contrasting media.</p>
