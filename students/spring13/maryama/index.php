				<p>
I’m an international student, full time mother, designer, and a
passionate individual. I never settle for “good enough,” but am always
seeking what goes beyond expectancy and excellence. Hard work,
knowledge of others, and creativity is the heart of good design. That
is what I believe. I moved to Portland with the intention of exploring
life outside my home city. I am always looking for places where my
creativity will be fueled, where I can test my skills and knowledge as a
designer, and most importantly, where my talents for illustration and
brand identity will be nurtured.</p>
