        <h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">ALICIA Adelyn MORAN</h1>

        <p>Disguised as a young girl, I am zealously in love with Portland, Oregon. I am a collector of stories, friendships, and small paper goods. I am the maker of beautiful editorial design and have an extreme passion for found objects. I am an over-talker, a daydreamer, and a drinker. I am a firm believer that passionate work comes from passionate people. Curious to a fault and never likely to turn away a request for conversation, I will talk to you about work, life, design, and any other interesting or awkward subject. Just go ahead and ask.</p><img class="artwork" src="students/spring13/aliciam/img/alicia1.jpeg" alt="Moran Image 1"> <img class="artwork" src="students/spring13/aliciam/img/alicia2.jpeg" alt="Moran Image 2"> <img class="artwork" src="students/spring13/aliciam/img/alicia3.jpeg" alt="Moran IMage 3"></div>
