				<p>
				I never leave the house without my laptop, sketchpad, and pen. I am
inspired by the unusual, which brings a diverse voice to the work in my
portfolio. On a daily basis, I feel like I breathe design. I see it being a
living creature that evolves every time a person has a new idea. In my
work, this creature has a mind of its own. I tend toward clean layouts
with wild illustrations. I love to dive into artistic problems, looking for
creative solutions. I love conceptual work, where my illustrative style
can build entire worlds to explore.</p>
