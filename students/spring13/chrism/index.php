				<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">CHRIS MARQUISS</h1>
				<p>
				I am inspired by nature. I am motivated by my friends, my family,
and my peers. I love working with physical materials. I am energized
when working with my hands. I am passionate about discovering and
implementing interesting and accurate solutions to design problems.
I am obsessed by an attention to detail and maintain a deep seated
fear of bad letter spacing. From time to time, I do engage in
activities beyond design, including eating, drinking, reading, sleeping,
crossword puzzles, and basketball. But in everything, I am passionate.				</p>
