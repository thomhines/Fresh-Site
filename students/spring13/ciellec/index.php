				<p>
				I’ve been a lover of art and design since I was very young. I spent
days in my mom’s office picking out my favorite paper samples
and making little books and crafts. To this day, I get excited
about paper samples, interesting boxes, and any of the little
things that can make a project special. I love telling a story and
engaging an audience through design. I am constantly excited
and inspired by the work I see from talented people in our field.
I approach my work the way I approach people; with careful
consideration and a bit of humor.</p>
