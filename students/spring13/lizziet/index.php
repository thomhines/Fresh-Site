				<p>
				When I was in second grade my school had a contest to design
a new mode of transportation. I drew a wood plank with springs,
propellers, wheels and wings. I was surprised to win, and my prize
was to be chauffeured around town in a limo. This experience
convinced me that design and illustration would lead me into a life
of glamor and wonder. In my time at PSU, I have explored web design, branding,
illustration, and editorial design. I strive to create thoughtful
work that I hope will inspire, educate and help those who come in
contact with it.</p>
