				<h1 style="text-transform:uppercase;">dan lesage</h1>
				<p>
				I am a designer, illustrator, and outdoor-exploring native of Portland, Oregon. When I am not designing at my desk listening to John Denver, I can probably be found fly fishing or kayaking on one of Oregon’s many rivers, sharpening my strikeout skills on a baseball diamond, or hiking and camping in Eastern Oregon. After a year at Pacific Northwest College of Art as an illustration major, and earning an Associate's degree in Phoenix, Arizona, I thought I might want to be a paralegal. For the past nine years I have worked at a large corporate law firm, the last half while attending Portland State. This rigorous schedule taught me the value of hard work. Now that I know my heart belongs to design, I’m excited to apply my unique perspective and skills, working in a creative atmosphere.</p>
