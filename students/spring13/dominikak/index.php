				<p>
				I went to my first volleyball practice when I was nine years old
and I haven’t stopped playing since. Sport has taught me that
if you want to be good at something, you have to practice and
practice and practice. I was born in Slovakia, but after spending
my junior year of high school in the United States, I was offered
an athletic scholarship to Portland State University. I have
always been creative, so I have loved earning an undergraduate
degree in graphic design with a minor in printmaking. I am
particularly passionate about illustration and am looking forward
to attending university in Britain to earn a master’s degree.</p>
