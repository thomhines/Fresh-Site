  <p>FRESH is an invitation-only review held at the end of every <a target="_blank" href="http://psu.gd">PSUGD</a> Senior Portfolio class. FRESH typically happens three times a year (December, June and the end of August). The event is organized by the graduating students. It not only showcases their work, but gives them an opportunity to receive valuable feedback from respective design leaders, and make connections with the design community.</p>
