			FRESH is an invitation-only review held at the end of every PSUGD Senior Portfolio class. FRESH typically happens three times a year (December, June and the end of August). The event is put on by the students and not only showcases their graduating work, but also gives them an opportunity to get valuable feedback from respective design leaders.
