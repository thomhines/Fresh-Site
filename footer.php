                    FRESH is an invitation-only review held at the end of every PSUGD Senior Portfolio class. FRESH typically happens three times a year (December, June and the end of August). The event is put on by the students and not only showcases their graduating work, but also gives them an opportunity to get valuable feedback from respective design leaders.

                    <p>Nearly every term, students graduate from the Portland State Graphic Design program and throw an awesome event that we call FRESH. This is an opportunity for recent grads to meet professionals working in the field, show off their work, and make connections with the community.</p>

                    <p>Our Spring 2017 graduating class decided on a science fair theme because, for us, it feels like we’ve come full circle. As designers, we are united by our passion for experimentation, discovery, and progress. We’ve done the research, met every challenge, cultivated curiosity, and now we’re taking off. Basically, we’re geniuses and we can prove it. Come join us as we celebrate the end of one phase and the beginning of another.
